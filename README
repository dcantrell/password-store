======================================

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

This project is based on the work at http://www.passwordstore.org/.  This
fork is meant to preserve the functionality of the program while adjusting
the runtime requirements a bit.  The main change was making script not
depend on GNU bash.  Other changes followed.

Patches are welcome.

Please see the man page for documentation and examples.
