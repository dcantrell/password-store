======================================

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

This project is based on the work at http://www.passwordstore.org/.  This
fork is meant to preserve the functionality of the program while adjusting
the runtime requirements a bit.  The main change was making script not
depend on GNU bash.  Other changes followed.

Patches are welcome.

Please see the man page for documentation and examples.

Depends on:
- More or less POSIX-compatible shell (e.g., dash)
  http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/ash/

  NOTE: The upstream project requires bash.  Bash will probably work, but
  the focus of this fork is to not depend on bash, zsh, or other shells
  that are less portable.

- GnuPG 1.x or 2.x
  http://www.gnupg.org/

- tree >= 1.7.0

- GNU getopt
